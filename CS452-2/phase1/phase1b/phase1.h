dispatcher:
seteps:
1. create a old_process = current
2. curTime = currentTime();

3. blocking case:the current process doesn't want to continue running
     if current->runnable_status != 0 then remove current do following while removing the current:
                                            current->totalTimeConsumed += currentTime() - current->timeSliceStart;
                                            current->timeSliceStart = -1;
                                            current = NULL
4. preempted case:
    the current process must yield for a higher-priority process (preempted case)
5. NOP case: if a current process is running, and it's happy to continue running, and if its timeslice hasn't expired,
then just let it keep going.
6. timeslice-expired case, has two sub-cases:
     *     Nothing else runnable in the same priority - keep running, but reset the timeslice counter.
     *     Else, put this at the end of the run queue and dispatch as if we
     *           didn't have a current process.
7. Now if we get here means we have to find new process to run,
    run a loop with till 7 (total priority): find a process with runnable state and remove that from list
8. mmu_flush() : must be called *BEFORE* we update 'current'.
9. assign current = new found process;
10. Now do the USLOSS_ContextSwitch with old process to current process or new process
11. keep track of clock variables: current->timeSliceStart = currentTime
