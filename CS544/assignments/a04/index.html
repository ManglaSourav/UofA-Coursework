    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <div>
      In order to show a continuous range of values, a sequential color map utilizes a variety of colors in a certain
      order.
      Typically, data with a range of low to high values are represented using this style of color map.
      <br />
      A diverging color map, on the other hand, combines two contrasting colors to indicate values that fluctuate around
      a
      central point or a reference value. This kind of color map is frequently used to depict data that has a natural
      midpoint
      or reference point, such as data that has a natural zero point or data that spans from positive to negative
      values.
      <br />
      I would choose a sequential color scheme since it can clearly show the relative size differences between the
      categories
      or subcategories that are being shown. Also, the use of a consistent color scheme makes it easy to compare the
      sizes of different categories or subcategories, as
      well as to identify the largest and smallest categories or subcategories.

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <div>
      Geometric zooming is a zooming approach that keeps the original appearance of interface visual components while
      scaling
      them up or down. In other terms, geometric zooming only enlarges or reduces an object's size without altering its
      shape
      or significance.
      <br />
      Semantic zooming is a zooming approach where, when the user zooms in or out, the content or meaning of an
      interface
      changes. In interfaces that display hierarchical or layered information, such as maps.

    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <div>
      Scenario where treemaps are a better choice:
      <br />
      Suppose We are examining a sizable amount of hierarchically organized data, similar to a directory of files on
      your
      computer. The size of each file and folder in the directory, as well as how they are nested inside one another,
      should
      be visible. A treemap might be a good option in this situation. A file or folder would be represented by a
      rectangle in
      the treemap, and the rectangle's size would correspond to the file or folder's size. To demonstrate the
      hierarchical
      links between the files and directories, the rectangles would be nested inside of one another. As a result, it
      would be
      simple for us to determine which files and folders are occupying the most space as well as how they are arranged
      inside
      the directory.
      <br />
      <br />
      Scenario where node-link diagrams are a better choice:
      <br />
      Suppose we are analyzing a social network and want to see how the participants are connected to one another. A
      node-link
      diagram would be the best option in this scenario. The diagram's nodes stand in for individual users, while the
      connections between them signify their connections. The user clusters that are more tightly related to one
      another
      might be highlighted in the diagram by how it is established. Using this, we may quickly determine the network's
      organizational structure, the users that are more important or influential, and the communities that are present.
