    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <div>
      Choropleth maps are used to display data on a geographic area by shading or coloring each region based on a
      specific variable.
      One possible setting where one might prefer to use a choropleth is when the data being presented is continuous and
      distributed evenly over the geographic regions. For instance, a choropleth map can be effective in displaying
      population density by state or county, where each region is shaded to represent the density of the population.
      Choropleth map provides an accurate representation of the data
      across the geographic area.
      <br />
      <br />
      Cartograms are used to convey information by distorting the size and shape of the regions based on the data.
      Cartograms can be effective when the data being presented is highly variable and not evenly distributed over the
      geographic regions. For example, a cartogram can be useful in displaying the results of a presidential election,
      where
      the size of the state or county is distorted based on the number of votes. In this case, the cartogram provides a
      clear visual representation of the results.

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <div>
      The ambiguous case occurs when a contour line passes through a grid cell at a diagonal angle, and the values of
      the
      neighboring cells are such that the algorithm cannot uniquely determine the correct configuration of line segments
      to
      generate. This results in a situation where the algorithm can generate multiple possible configurations of line
      segments
      that all approximate the same contour line, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency in the resulting output.
      <br />
      One possible fix is to modify the input data by adding small amounts of noise to break up the symmetry and prevent
      the ambiguous case
      from occurring. This approach can be effective but may also introduce additional noise into the data.

    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <div>
      Sequential color transfer function works well when there is a smooth transition between different scalar values in
      the field means If we want to demonstrate how the data gradually changes.
      <br />
      A diverging color transfer function can be useful when the data has a center point and ranges in both positive and
      negative values.
      <br />
      A categorical color transfer function is useful when the data is unordered and consists of discrete categories.
      This color transfer function can be used to represent different materials or structures in the field, such as
      different
      rock formations in a geological simulation.
