    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <div>
      Size and color are representing the magnitude of a vector. Orientation of the shape representing the direction of
      a vector. Size and color are used as visual channels particularly for representing magnitude because they
      can be directly and accurately measured by the human visual system. By using different sizes of glyphs to
      represent different magnitudes of a
      vector
      field, we can create a clear and intuitive visual representation of the data.
      Color is also useful for highlighting spatial patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent from other
      visual channels. Like, we can use a color scale to highlight regions of high or low magnitude in the vector
      field.
      <br />
      By aligning the shape of a glyph with the direction of the vector field at a point, we can create a clear and
      intuitive
      representation of the direction of the vector. Also, allowing us to visually trace the direction of the vector
      field across the flow domain.

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <div>
      Isocontours can divide into two different portions, come together as two independent contours, or reconnect with
      themselves to form a single closed contour at critical points that are saddles in two dimensions.

    </div>
    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <div>
      The drawback of using a texture-based technique to view flow fields is that the underlying flow topology is
      inaccurately
      represented. It could cause ambiguities and distortions in the visualization, making it challenging to
      differentiate
      between various forms of flow and difficult to fully understand the depth. But Geometric techniques rely on the
      visualization of streamlines or other geometric structures to convey flow information.

      <br />
      The strength of texture-based techniques to represent local changes in flow velocity and direction is their
      strength.
      Texture patterns can be created to draw attention to regions of fast or slow flow and to the flow's direction.
      However, geometric techniques may be less effective at conveying local variations in flow, and can be more
      computationally
      expensive to generate.
