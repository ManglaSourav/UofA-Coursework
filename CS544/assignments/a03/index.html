    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <div>
      a. onClick
      <br />
      Action: Click on a label
      <br />
      Target: Swapping the axis and the lebel with immediate right axis and label with exception of the rightmost axis
      and label.
      <br />
      By performing this action, Users can look for patterns in the lines between two variables by swapping the axes.
      <br />
      <br />
      b. onMouseOver
      <br />
      Action: Hover mouse over label
      <br />
      Target: Bolding the label and changing the color of all polylines to reflect a color scale designed for that
      axis.
      <br />
      By performing this action, Users can look for patterns in the lines for a single variable with other variables.
      <br />
      <br />
      c. Brushing
      <br />
      Action: Brush over axes
      <br />
      Target: select range of values for each axis
      <br />
      By performing this action, Users can look for patterns showing only the points that fall within the selected range
      of values between axes.
      <br />

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <div>
      I selected colors for a parallel coordinates plot that are easily distinguishable from
      each
      other. This is important because the purpose of a parallel coordinates plot is to show the relationships between
      different variables, and using colors that are too similar can make it difficult to distinguish between them.
      I used a default color scheme for the parallel coordinates plot, but I also added a color scale for each axis for
      OnMouseOver event as it is required in the specs.

    </div>
    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <div>
      One advantage of parallel coordinates over scatterplot matrices is that parallel coordinates can effectively
      handle a
      large number of variables. In a scatterplot matrix, each variable is plotted against every other variable, which
      can
      quickly become overwhelming and difficult to interpret as the number of variables increases.
      <br />
      One disadvantage of parallel coordinates compared to scatterplot matrices is that parallel coordinates can be more
      difficult to read and interpret when the range of the variables differs significantly. In a scatterplot matrix,
      each
      variable is plotted on its own scale, which allows for easy comparison between variables.
