    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <div>
      Adjusting the stroke color is an effective choice for employing popout to highlight selected points.
      When adjusting the stroke color, increasing the contrast between the selected points and their surroundings can
      make them stand out more. In some cases, it may be more effective to use other design techniques to create a
      popout effect,
      such as changing the size or shape of the selected points or adding a background color or texture to create
      contrast.
      But I think adjusting the stroke color is a good choice because it is able to convey the information.

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <div>
      Nominal data attributes are categorical variables that can be named or labeled, but do not have any inherent order
      or
      rank. Quantitative is something that has a well-defined order and can be measured, whereas ordinal is something
      that has a
      clearly defined order and can perform comparisons. Calculations and comparisons are both possible with
      quantitative data.
      <br />
      With the exception of species, which I believe is ordinal because you can group the species and compare them, I
      believe
      all the attributes in the datasets provided for this assignment are quantitative because you can perform some sort
      of
      calculation on them.

    <h4>Question 3</h4>

      Definitely, Using a rectangular brush can be particularly useful for selecting subsets of data that have a clear
      boundary or shape,
      gives satisfying interaction in my experiment.
      <br>
      One strength of brushing and linking with a rectangular brush is that it provides a flexible and intuitive way for
      users
      to explore and analyze subsets of data within a larger dataset.
      <br />
      One limitation of brushing and linking with a rectangular brush is that it may not be as effective for selecting
      more
      complex or irregular subsets of data that don't fit neatly within a rectangular shape.
